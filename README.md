##👋 Hi there, I’m Damjan Janeski 👋
# I currently dive deeply into the developer's world, enthusiasticly trying to explore, discover and learn new skills and features. 
🔍 I’m interested in expanding my knowlegde, improve and apply everything I've learned till now and simply reach and pass new limits and horizons in the programming's field.
‎‍💼 I’m currently working on simple projects, using JavaScript (React), HTML and CSS, but other frameworks also spark my curiosity, so my programming ambitions will not stop here.
👨‍💻 Focused on the front-end, but also open to upgrade my expirience with back-end challenges. 
📫 Feel free to contact me on my email: djaneski10@gmail.com
