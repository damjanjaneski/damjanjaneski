 <h4>
🔍 I’m interested in expanding my knowlegde, improve and apply everything I've learned till now and simply reach and pass new limits and horizons in the programming's field.</br>
‎‍💼 I’m currently working on simple projects, using JavaScript (React), HTML and CSS, but other frameworks also spark my curiosity, so my programming ambitions will not stop here.</br>
👨‍💻 Focused on the front-end, but also open to upgrade my expirience with back-end challenges. </br>
